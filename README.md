## HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
This repository is for the 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Challenge. The Challenge is designed to prepare you for scenarios that you are likely to encounter as a web developer.

### Challenge Types
The course consists of two types of Challenges that you'll come across as a web developer.
1.	On-the-job ticket or feature request Challenges provides starter code in a folder called Develop, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.
2.	Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.

### Challenge Elements
Each Challenge in this course contains the following elements:
1.	User Story: This is a short, simple description of a feature that follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."
2.	Acceptance Criteria: These are the minimum requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. The criteria can be presented in various ways, and in this course, we'll use the WHEN / THEN format.
3.	Mock-up: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.
4.	Submission: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review.

### Challenge Description
This week's Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, and you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. The Challenge requires you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. Refactoring existing code to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers.
An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business, and it also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.
Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.
To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
Challenge Requirements

### User Story
AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines 
### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 
WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
WHEN I view the icon and image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes 
WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order 
WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
